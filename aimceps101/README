# Enhanced Aimceps: Advanced Aim Trainer Game developed from my initial simple aimceps101

## Overview
A simple project/game that I was passionate about that got me to start simple and finally add functionalities to. It offers multiple game modes, user authentication, and high score tracking.

## Features
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Static, Moving, and Shrinking targets
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with password hashing.
- **High Score Tracking**: Persistent storage of user scores across sessions.
- **Combo System**: Rewards players for consecutive hits.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Who doesn't love fullscreen gameplay..?
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for successful hits.

## Technical Aspects
- **Pygame**: Used for game development, handling graphics, sound, and user input.
- **SQLite**: Integrated for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular code structure with classes for Game, Targets, Menu, etc.
- **Database Handling**: Custom DatabaseHandler class for managing user data and scores.
- **Password Security**: Implemented using hashlib for secure storage of user credentials.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Utilized Pygame's event system for responsive user interactions.

## How to Play
1. Run the game and log in or create a new user account.
2. Choose a game mode from the main menu.
3. Aim and click heads baby!
4. View your high scores and compete with other players (or yourself with different usernames because you have no life).

## Installation
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repo
3. Navigate to the game directory
4. Run the game: `python main.py`/`./main.py`
